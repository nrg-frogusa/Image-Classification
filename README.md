# Image-Classification
To create an image classification algorithm, utilizing a neural network, to classify images into separate categories.

#Analysis Steps
First, you load your data and examine the contents. 
Then, you create a function that creates the neural network that will classify images later.
Then, create a construction function that constructs the neural network using the parameters needed or desired.
Next, you call on the keras tuner/optimizer to optimize the models to find which one produces the best/most accurate results.
Once you know which model produces the best results, use that one to predict/classify the images against the test set.
Finally, look at the accuracy scores and confusion matrix that the chosen model produced to determine how well the neural network did at classifying the images in the data set.

#Conclusion
My neural network performed well in classifying images, with some trouble with digits like 5 and 3, 4 and 9, and others. Overall, the accuracy score was 97.62%.
